gz2_BCgenes.py  gz2_BCgenes.sh are both scripts necesary to obtain barcodes and genes for the sparse matrix in format .raw.dge.txt.gz obtained from Saunders et al (DropViz.org shiny app), example of such file   "F_GRCm38.81.P60Cortex_noRep5_FRONTALonly.raw.dge.txt.gz", decompressed:

%%GENES	00123456789Rik ...
%%GENES	A...
...
%%GENES	Zfp583	Zfp59	Zfp592	Zfp593 ...
...
%%CELL_BARCODES	P60FCRep2P2_AGAGACCTGATA ...
...
%%MATRIX	...


Each %% line (except %%MATRIX) contains a group of elements in alphabetical order, so there is as a whole a hierarchy of alphabetical groups (a line with number.starting.strings, then lines A to Z)

%%MATRIX part is automatically decompressed by R functions given in DropViz.org > Data > Instruction for loading DGE files. The GENES and CELL_BARCODES are not loaded automatically, maybe owing to conflicts with the R version I am using (> 4.1)


## important 
see : https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000794686-How-is-the-MEX-format-used-for-the-gene-barcode-matrices-

because the format ressembles MATRIX EXCHANGE (MEX) format but they did not provide barcodes.tsv nor genes.tsv, instead integrated that info
inside "dge.txt" file, and then they compressed
